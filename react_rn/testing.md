# React Testing Library
- uses [jest](../js/jest.md) internally
- provides apis to query and assert on the DOM
- provides apis to render dom using `render`, `screen`.
  - using `createRoot` method is the recommended best practice now
- `userEvent` can be used to simulate user clicking/typing etc on the dom elements
- various queries are provided.
  - `getByX` - throws exception if dom node not found (fails the test b4 expect)
  - `queryByX` - returns null if dom node not found (runs the expect)
  - `await findByX` - waits until dom node is visible
- `await waitFor`
  - we can write queries/assertions inside the callback for `waitFor`
  - it wiats for the assertions inside it to pass.
  - useful when testing if dom element is removed from dom.
  - can pass `options` to set _max wait_ etc.
- `getByRole`
  - can pass an **accessible name/any other accessiblility param** to options arg of `getByRole`
  - will ensure accessibility is maintained
