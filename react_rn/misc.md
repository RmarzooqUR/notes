### about naming ur react component files. 
- think about how a file name would be written in imports and when multiple files are open in ur editor
- if all comps have an `index.js`, can't differentiate in editor
- if all comps are named `component.js` , import become `import ../componenet/component.js`
- so, use an `index.js` alongside `Component.js` in the compoenent dir.
- the index.js just exports ur component.
