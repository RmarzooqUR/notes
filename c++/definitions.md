- **Cross Compilation**
  - a cross compiler is capable of compiling the source code into its binaries which may be used on another machine
  - this is useful when the target machine is not capable of supporting the compiler and source files
  - useful in embedded devices
  - ***NASA astrobee uses cross compilation for its ros software to be able to run on astrobee***
